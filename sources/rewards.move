/// This module is intended to distribute daily rewards on admin submission with
/// the following rules:
/// - An admin sends the addresses daily
/// - The number of addresses is fixed and set to X
/// - Addresses are sent in the specified order
/// - The order matches the reward distribution (1st place - 1st reward, etc.)
/// - The rewards amount is fixed and is calculated for 1 month
///
/// Notes:
/// - 5000 SUI per 30 days is ~ 167 SUI per day. For 10 users it's 16.7 SUI per day on average
